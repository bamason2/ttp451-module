## Coursework Assignment 2 Supplementary Assessment: Planning experiments (25%)

In an investigation of a new Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) powertrain there are several new systems to be proven and understood and finally calibrated.

For the new powertrain considered in this study the powertrain is in series configuration with braking energy recovery and a 37kWh battery system that is cooled naturally with no active thermal management.

Write a short report, no longer than three pages in length (excluding appendices), describing and explaining an experimental strategy that includes investigation of:

- Vehicle launch strategy in 'eco' and 'sports' mode.
- SOC management strategy for typical driving.
- Battery management to minimise performance degradation (aging)

Start the report with a description of how the experiments you undertake will be used to make decisions in respect of the points above and make sure to identify the factors and response variables of concern to this investigation.  Pay particular attention to how your experimental plan progresses as more becomes known about the system(s). Explain what the response surface models built from the experimental data will be used for and describe qualitatively any mathematical optimisation that will be undertaken.

You should address the report to a team leader whose job it is to scope the experimental programme.

### Assessment

The report will be marked according to the following scheme with marks split between Technical, Report / Writing Style and Presentation. Some guidance is provided below as to how the marks will be allocated.

#### Technical (65%)

The facts stated are correct and relevant.  Correct statements are made about the technology and methodology proposed. The experimental strategy presented considers the points outlined above.

The proposed strategy draws on evidence presented within the report and by way of reference to other sources of information that are appropriately cited. A minimum of five external sources of information (excluding course notes/slides) are included.  The sources are used in a meaningful way in the report i.e. to support the decisions made and/or provide a background/further information on the topics discussed.

#### Report / Writing style (20%)

The style of the report and writing is appropriate for a technical document (see the guidance provided by this document on [Report Writing](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/media/wwwlboroacuk/content/library/downloads/advicesheets/Report%20writing.pdf) for further information). The way in which it is written is convincing and includes the necessary information providing a convincing argument for the strategy proposed as would be judged by a person reasonably familiar with the topic.

#### Presentation (15%)

The structure of the report is well considered and includes the necessary headings and sections. Graphics that are included are laid out well.  The font style, space and sizing is appropriate.  Presentation overall is appropriate. Figures are appropriately labelled. Plots include a title and axis labels as well as units (where appropriate). The report is an appropriate length (no more than 10% longer than the page limit).
