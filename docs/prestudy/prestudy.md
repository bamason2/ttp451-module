# Pre-Study Material

There are three documents which form the material element of pre-study; these need to be followed prior to the commencement of the short course. A brief outline of the contents of these is given below.

## Part 1 – Introduction to Model-Based Calibration (MBC)

The first part of the pre study material introduces the user to the calibration process and more specifically the model-based approach to calibration. It provides the user with a comparison between conventional and model-based calibration approaches as well as exposing the user to one-stage and two-stage experimental approaches. These are discussed in the light of engine testing.

## Part 2 – Design of Experiments (DoE) Workshop Notes

The secondary part of the pre-study material will contain information regarding differing types of Design of Experiment. Also, as a build on from part 1, the file structure and interface in MBC will be highlighted. This is to accelerate the learning process in subsequent exercises.

## Part 3 – Design of Experiments Workshop Exercise

The final part of the pre-study material, this section contains the steps required to create several experimental designs. The purpose of this part is to develop a familiarisation with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the design browser in MBC toolbox prior to the modules lab classes.
