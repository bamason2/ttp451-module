# Overview

![image](process_overview.png)

## Week 1

The first part of the lecture for this week introduces the module and the assessment structure. In the second part we will look at what calibration is.

As more technology is added to vehicles the complexity of the control system increases significantly. Powertrain controllers may have up to 50,000 parameters. Typically, up to 5000 of these may be changed to influence performance in terms of drivability, emissions and energy consumption. Calibration is the process by which information is obtained and decisions made to change parameter values to improve performance.  In this first session we will be looking at, in overview, the various parts of the process and how these fit together to help engineers achieve optimal hardware performance. As we will see regardless of the powertrain technology, the process remains largely the same containing elements of optimisation, design of experiments, mathematical modelling and experimentation.

## Week 2

At the core of the calibration process is the requirement to specify experiments, execute them to obtain data and create mathematical models based on this data. This could include emissions control systems, electric motors, engines, etc. These mathematical models are then used within a search algorithm or optimisation routine to find calibration parameter values that achieve best performance.

Underpinning all of the mathematical modelling is fundamental statistics that helps specify experiments, interpret results and create mathematical models. This week we will be looking at reviewing some fundamental statistical principles as we begin to consider these topics.
